# Pygame Chess

This is a Python project that implements a chess game using the Pygame library. It allows players to play a game of chess on a graphical interface.

## Features

The project consists of two main files:

1. `main.py`: This file contains the main logic of the chess game. It handles the game loop, user input, and rendering of the game board.

2. `features.py`: This file contains additional features used in the game, such as the `Button` and `InputBox` classes for creating interactive elements, and the `MYSQL` class for database operations.

## Getting Started

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. Import the database provided as `schema.sql`

3. Fill in the environment variables in .env

4. Run the `main.py` file using Python: `python main.py`.

5. The game window will open, and you can start playing chess.

## How to Play

1. Use the mouse to select and move the chess pieces on the board.

2. The game follows the standard rules of chess. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's king.

3. The opponent moves as well, however as of now, the board will remain flipped in the other direction sorry :(. It will be fixed later
